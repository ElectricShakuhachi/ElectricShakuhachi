- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ElectricShakuhachi

  Trainee at Nokia Solutions and Networks,
defining and supporting on the usage of their CI infrastructure for SoC engineers.

Studying CS at University of Helsinki and working on Unix and Algorithm skills at the Hive Coding School

Currently I am a T-shaped person - as in I have a general touch to a wide array of technologies with some depth here and there.
But looking to be an O-shaped person
(not too hard to do in the physical sphere, but what I mean is that I'm aspiring to increase my knowledge on every front)

Most experienced with Python development and testing, Jenkins and CI in general.
Growing my capabilities with Python related frameworks and stacks, namingly flask, django, numpy, pandas and the like.
Learning also about sql databases, docker, kubernetes and planning to learn comprehensively about AI. (with some knowledge into
common frameworks on it, but at the moment interested to gain a low-abstraction undestanding by devising simplistic ML schemes from
scratch.)
